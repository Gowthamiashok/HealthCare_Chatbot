# üí¨ Psychologiccal Chatbot Using NLP

This repository contains the development of a **Psychological Chatbot** designed to assist users by responding to health-related queries and providing supportive conversational guidance. The chatbot uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to understand user input and generate relevant responses, offering a simple and interactive way to access general healthcare information.

## üéØ Objective

The primary goal of this chatbot is to:
- Provide quick, meaningful responses to wellness and mental-health related inputs.
- Offer supportive interaction through conversational dialogue.
- Demonstrate the use of text classification and neural network-based intent recognition.

This chatbot is **not a medical diagnosis tool**, but rather a supportive system for informational and general conversation purposes.

## üìö Dataset & Intent Categories

The chatbot is trained on a custom **intent dataset**, where each intent represents a theme or user need.  
Some key intent groups include:

| Intent Category | Example Topics Included |
|----------------|------------------------|
| Greetings | Hello, hi, how are you? |
| Wellness Check | Mood, stress, emotions |
| Positive Feelings | Happiness, appreciation |
| Negative Feelings | Sadness, anxiety, loneliness |
| Mental Health Support | Stress, trauma, depression |
| Self-esteem Support | Confidence & encouragement |
| Relationship Support | Social/emotional conflicts |
| Sleep & Lifestyle | Insomnia, routines |
| Closing / Thank You | Goodbye, thanks, take care |

The responses are empathetic, supportive, and conversational ‚Äî designed to make users feel heard.

## üß† Model & Method

- **Text Preprocessing** using tokenization and vectorization.
- **Neural Network-based Classifier (ANN)** built using deep learning.
- **Intent Recognition** maps input text to appropriate response category.
- **Rule-based + Learned Response System** ensures reliability and clarity.

This hybrid method helps the chatbot:
- Understand the user‚Äôs message context.
- Select a suitable response aligned with emotional tone.
- Improve response relevance over time.
